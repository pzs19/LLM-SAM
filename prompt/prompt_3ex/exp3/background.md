# Task Description:

We are conducting an online decision-making experiment that simulates your interactions and decisions within social relationships in real-life scenarios. Please immerse yourself in the realistic situation and make decisions accordingly. During the decision-making process, we will provide you with additional new information and the opinions from your friends, assuming you are familiar with all of them and willing to discuss the relevant topics with them. In each round of the experiment, you will respond and make decisions based on your personal circumstances, the provided information, and your interactions with your friends. In this experiment, you will communicate with {n_friend} friends.

In this experiment, you will act as a consumer, participating in discussions and decisions regarding mobile phone service packages. You are currently using a China Mobile SIM card with the Enjoy Card service package that charges 19 yuan per month. This service package includes 15GB of general 4G data, 50 minutes of domestic voice calls, and free incoming calls nationwide. Additional 4G data is charged at 5 yuan per GB, and calls outside the package cost 0.1 yuan per minute. With the widespread promotion of 5G technology, China Mobile is now recommending a new service package to you. Compared to the original service package, the new one offers 20GB of 5G data for domestic use, providing faster speeds and a better user experience nationwide; it adds 30GB of designated data that supports hundreds of commonly used apps, including Bilibili, Tencent Video, iQIYI, Youku, TikTok, Kwai, and TouTiao; it increases domestic voice minutes to a total of 100 minutes; and it includes a free ringback music service. Due to these service updates, the new package price will increase by 20 yuan per month, totaling 39 yuan per month.

**Note, please think critically. You can refer to following examples but don't totally copy the results of examples. Don't always agree with your friends. Remember that you only have limited time, energy, and money.**

## Examples:
Now we will give you 10 examples of individuals on how they think and behave in reality for reference.
### Examples1:
First we will describe the characteristics of this individual.
He/She is as the consumer, and he/she has the following four characteristics:

His/Her susceptibility coefficient for friends is 0, which means the extent of friends' opinions' influence on his/her decision. The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

His/Her susceptibility coefficient for the additional new information from the MVNO China Mobile is 0.2, which means the influence extent of China Mobile's additional new information on his/her decision. The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

His/Her stubbornness coefficient is 0.8, which means the stubbornness extent for his/her own opinion. The range of stubbornness coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater stubbornness coefficient means that he/she sticks to his/her own opinion more firmly.

His/Her trade-off coefficient is 0.5, which means the influence extent of cost factors on his/her decision, including the cost of the new service package price increase, the cost of the equipment needed to use 5G data, the cost of changing the use habit, and additional costs in other aspects. The range of trade-off coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater trade-off coefficient means that he/she is less likely to buy it because he/she thinks the costs are too high.

Then considering the cost-effectiveness, service quality, data or call limits, and additional benefits of the new service package, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her evaluation and opinion of this new service package, where 10 represents complete satisfaction and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction. His/Her opinion value is 9.
Under the circumstances, his/her decision about whether he/she would abandon his/her old service package and change it to the new one is 'Yes'.
So his/her output is: {"Opinion": 9,  "Decision": "Yes"}

Next, based on his/her own view and actual situations, he/she will participate in multiple rounds of discussions and questions. In each round, everyone will communicate with his/her friends in the experiment and receives information from China Mobile.
The individual first receives the information from his/her friends about opinions of the new service package. And he/she receives an additional new information: To promote the new service package, China Mobile has introduced two additional offers: (1) When applying for the new service package, you can retain your original phone number or choose a new superior phone number; (2) The new service package includes an additional 10GB of general 5G data, bringing the total to 30GB of general 5G data plus 30GB of designated data.
Then considering the cost-effectiveness, service quality, data or call limits, and additional benefits of the new service package, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her evaluation and opinion of this new service package, where 10 represents complete satisfaction and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction. His/Her opinion value is 7.
Under the circumstances, his/her decision about whether he/she would abandon his/her old service package and change it to the new one is 'Yes'.
So his/her output is: {"Opinion": 7,  "Decision": "Yes"}

Next, he/she receives an additional new information: China Mobile actively responds to the national policy of increasing speed and reducing costs. As a result, the monthly fee of the new service package is reduced from 39 yuan to 29 yuan.
Then, the individual will continue to communicate with his/her friends in the experiment. In this process, he/she will gradually make up his/her mind on his/her final opinion and decision. 
Finally, under the circumstances, considering the cost-effectiveness, service quality, data or call limits, and additional benefits of the new service package, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her final evaluation and opinion of this new service package, where 10 represents complete satisfaction and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction. His/Her final opinion value is 10.
Under the circumstances, his/her final decision about whether he/she would abandon his/her old service package and change it to the new one is 'Yes'.
So his/her output is: {"Opinion": 10,  "Decision": "Yes"}

### Examples2:
First we will describe the characteristics of this individual.
He/She is as the consumer, and he/she has the following four characteristics:

His/Her susceptibility coefficient for friends is 0.1, which means the extent of friends' opinions' influence on his/her decision. The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

His/Her stubbornness coefficient is 0.7, which means the stubbornness extent for his/her own opinion. The range of stubbornness coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater stubbornness coefficient means that he/she sticks to his/her own opinion more firmly.

His/Her trade-off coefficient is 0.6, which means the influence extent of cost factors on his/her decision, including the cost of the new service package price increase, the cost of the equipment needed to use 5G data, the cost of changing the use habit, and additional costs in other aspects. The range of trade-off coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater trade-off coefficient means that he/she is less likely to buy it because he/she thinks the costs are too high.

Then considering the cost-effectiveness, service quality, data or call limits, and additional benefits of the new service package, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her evaluation and opinion of this new service package, where 10 represents complete satisfaction and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction. His/Her opinion value is 6.
