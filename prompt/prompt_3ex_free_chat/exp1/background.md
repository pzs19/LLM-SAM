# Task Description:

We are conducting an online decision-making experiment that simulates your interactions and decisions within social relationships in real-life scenarios. Please immerse yourself in the realistic situation and make decisions accordingly. During the decision-making process, we will provide you with additional new information and the opinions from your friends, assuming you are familiar with all of them and willing to discuss the relevant topics with them. In each round of the experiment, you will respond and make decisions based on your personal circumstances, the provided information, and your interactions with your friends. In this experiment, you will communicate with {n_friend} friends.

In this experiment, you will act as the decision-maker in a household, participating in discussions and decisions about purchasing a dishwasher. A dishwasher is a device that automatically cleans dishes, chopsticks, plates, bowls, knives, forks, and other tableware. The price of home dishwashers ranges from 1,500 to over 10,000 yuan. Currently, there is an embedded FOTILE dishwasher, which combines three functions: washing, sanitizing, and storing dishes. It can hold 16 sets of tableware (suitable for more than 7 people, with a super-large capacity) and can be remotely controlled via an app on your smartphone. The price of this dishwasher is 6,999 yuan. Since it is installed under the kitchen cabinet, you need to determine if cabinet and plumbing modifications are necessary based on the cabinet size before purchasing. The potential extra cost includes: (1) the basic package price for cutting of side panels, base panels, and back panels as well as drilling holes in the cabinet and utility modifications is 300 yuan; (2) the price for sealing panels, new door panel edging, and door panel installation is 200 yuan per piece.

**Note, please think critically. You can refer to following examples but don't totally copy the results of examples. Don't always agree with your friends. Remember that you only have limited time, energy, and money.**

## Examples:
Now we will give you 10 examples of individuals on how they think and behave in reality for reference.
### Examples1:
First we will describe the characteristics of this individual. 
He/she is as the decision-makers in a household, and he/she has the following four characteristics:

His/Her susceptibility coefficient for friends is 0.1, which means the extent of friends' opinions' influence on his/her decisions. The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

His/Her susceptibility coefficient for the additional new information from provider/shopping platform is 0.2, which means the influence extent of provider's/shopping platform's additional new information on his/her decisions. The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

His/Her stubbornness coefficient is 0.7, which means the stubbornness extent for his/her own opinion. The range of stubbornness coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater stubbornness coefficient means that they stick to their own opinion more firmly.

His/Her trade-off coefficient is 0.6, which means the influence extent of cost factors on his/her decisions, including purchase cost of the dishwasher, the installation and maintenance cost of the dishwasher, the additional water and electricity resource consumption of the dishwasher, and the other additional cost of the dishwasher. The range of trade-off coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater trade-off coefficient means that they are less likely to buy it because they think the costs are too high.

Then considering aspects such as the product's appearance, functionality, specifications, reliability, and practicality, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her evaluation and opinion of this dishwasher, where 10 represents complete satisfaction with the dishwasher and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction. His/Her opinion value is 6.
Under the circumstances, his/her decision about whether he/she would purchase this dishwasher is 'Yes'.

So his output is:
{"Opinion": 6,  "Decision": "Yes"}

Next, based on individual's own view and family's actual situation, the individual will participate in multiple rounds of discussions and questions. In each round, everyone will communicate with his/her friends in the experiment and receive information from the provider FOTILE or shopping platforms.
The individual first receive the information from his/her friends about their opinions of this dishwasher. And he/she receive the additional new information: against the backdrop of a furniture festival hosted by the platform, the official discounted price of this dishwasher has been reduced to 5,349 yuan (the original price is 6,999 yuan).
Then considering aspects such as the product's appearance, functionality, specifications, reliability, and practicality, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her evaluation and opinion of this dishwasher, where 10 represents complete satisfaction with the dishwasher and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction. His/Her opinion value is 7.
Under the circumstances, his/her decision about whether he/she would purchase this dishwasher is 'Yes'.

So his output is:
{"Opinion": 7,  "Decision": "Yes"}

Next, the individual receives an additional new information: the provider FOTILE has launched a large number of advertisements on social media platforms such as Weibo and Little Red Book, featuring product tutorials, customer experiences and more. They have also held online live-streaming events, inviting spokesperson Chuxi Zhong to promote the product and interact with the audience.
Then, the individual will continue to communicate with his/her friends in the experiment. In this process, he/she will gradually make up his/her minds on his/her final opinions and decisions. 
Finally, under the circumstances, considering aspects such as the product's appearance, functionality, specifications, reliability, and practicality, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her evaluation and final opinion of this dishwasher, where 10 represents complete satisfaction with the dishwasher and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction. His/Her final opinion value is 7.
Under the circumstances, his/her final decision about whether he/she would purchase this dishwasher is 'Yes'.

So his output is:
{"Opinion": 7,  "Decision": "Yes"}

### Examples2:
First we will describe the characteristics of this individual. 
He/she is as the decision-makers in a household, and he/she has the following four characteristics:

His/Her susceptibility coefficient for friends is 0, which means the extent of friends' opinions' influence on his/her decisions. The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

His/Her susceptibility coefficient for the additional new information from provider/shopping platform is 0, which means the influence extent of provider's/shopping platform's additional new information on his/her decisions. The range of susceptibility coefficient is between 0 and 1, and greater susceptibility coefficient represents the more significant influence.

His/Her stubbornness coefficient is 1, which means the stubbornness extent for his/her own opinion. The range of stubbornness coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater stubbornness coefficient means that they stick to their own opinion more firmly.

His/Her trade-off coefficient is 0.95, which means the influence extent of cost factors on his/her decisions, including purchase cost of the dishwasher, the installation and maintenance cost of the dishwasher, the additional water and electricity resource consumption of the dishwasher, and the other additional cost of the dishwasher. The range of trade-off coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the greater trade-off coefficient means that they are less likely to buy it because they think the costs are too high.

Then considering aspects such as the product's appearance, functionality, specifications, reliability, and practicality, he/she provides an integer score from 0 to 10 to express his/her evaluation and opinion of this dishwasher, where 10 represents complete satisfaction with the dishwasher and 0 represents complete dissatisfaction.
